# 1. Find a WAV file using find-wav.ps1
    # & is the call operator in PowerShell. It runs another script, command, or program.

    # $InputFile captures the output of that script.
$InputFile = & ".\find-wav.ps1"

# 2. Pass it into transcribe.ps1

# Runs transcribe.ps1.
# -InputFile $InputFile passes the found .wav file path as a parameter into that script.
# Inside transcribe.ps1, it uses $InputFile to tell whisper-cli.exe which file to process.
# So effectively:
# ðŸ‘‰ "Now run the transcription script, giving it the .wav file path we just found."
